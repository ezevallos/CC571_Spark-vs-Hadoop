## CountSales

This project created in Java will allow us to analyze a small database that is kept in a file called SalesJan2009.csv (for this particular case).

A brief description of the folders:

  * `src`: This folder contains the source files with which the tests are performed, here we will find the following files:
  
    - *SalesCountryDriver*: It is the file where we determine in which (or what) fields a search will be made for its count or designated operation.
    - *SalesCountryReducer*: This file is responsible for performing the count or designated operation.
    - *SalesMapper*: It is the file in charge of mapping the file we are entering.
  
  * `dist`: Contains the executable file * jar * that will perform the calculations set in the source files.
